GPIOJetsu.jl
==============


This package is derived from Ronisbr/BaremetalPi, and has the purpose to create a Julia interface with the peripherals of
the NVidia Jetson Nano without using any external libraries. Avoiding middlewares can
help to decrease latency for real-time applications.

## Status

This package should be considered alpha. It has been tested only against the
NVidia Jetson Nano. Help is needed to improve the reliability of the package.

## Supported peripherals

The following peripherals are currently supported:

* GPIO (without PWM).
* SPI.
* I2C (SMBUS).

## Requirements

* Julia >= 1.6
* Ubuntu >= 18.04

## Installation

```

Not ready for installation.
